Here's a question, what's the funniest joke you've seen a game pull off? What about the most impressive - is that the same? I have fond memories playing *Fallout: New Vegas* as a preteen, right in that sweet spot where a single bit of media could rewire my entire sense of humour (*Arrested Development* and the Cornetto trilogy were other such offenders). Half of, say, Fantastic's lines could just as easily have come from a Gob Bluth or a Gary King. That's not only to say "They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics." is a great gag, but also that it's told with the same techniques of wordplay and characterisation afforded to film and TV. Are there other, subtler ways of telling jokes exclusive to an interactive medium?

Early on in *Hades*, give or take a couple deaths, you'll likely run into Supergiant's take on Sisyphus: a cheery chap with an even cheerier boulder (just look at that big fella's winning smile!). You'll also most likely pick up 

Okay, so: what makes <a href="https://youtu.be/C6119Q9pDAk?t=478"><strong>this</strong></a> a joke?

Or, as comedian/streamer/*Great Australian Bake Off* host Tom Walker so eloquently puts it: *i knew it i knew do you see do you see they changed the fucking layout they ththththththey took it away.*

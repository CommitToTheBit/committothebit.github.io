Here's a question, what's the funniest joke you've seen a game pull off? What about the most impressive - is that the same? I have fond memories of playing *Fallout: New Vegas* as a preteen, right when a single piece of media could land a critical hit and rewire my entire sense of humour (*Arrested Development* and the Cornetto trilogy were other such offenders). "They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics." remains an absolute all-timer for me, one of many Fantastic gags that could just as easily have come from a Gob Bluth or a Gary King... which is to say, the humour comes from the wordplay and characterisation you could see on film or TV. Are there other, subtler ways of telling jokes afforded *only* to interactive media?

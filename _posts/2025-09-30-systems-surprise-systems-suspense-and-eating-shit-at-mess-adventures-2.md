Here's a question, what's the funniest joke you've seen a game pull off? What about the most impressive - is that the same? I have fond memories playing *Fallout: New Vegas* as a preteen, right in that sweet spot where a single bit of media could rewire my entire sense of humour (*Arrested Development* and the Cornetto trilogy were other such offenders). Half of, say, Fantastic's lines could just as easily have come from a Gob Bluth or a Gary King. "They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics." is a great gag, but it's one told with the same techniques of wordplay and characterisation afforded to film and TV. Are there other, subtler ways of telling jokes exclusive to an interactive medium?

Early on in *Hades*, you'll likely run into Supergiant's take on Sisyphus: a cheery chap with an even cheerier boulder (just look at that big fella's winning smile!). You'll just as likely pick up on the allusion to that old philosophical question, is Sisyphus happy? What reads like cheap reference humour, though, is really the game making a genuine point (and gently poking fun at you, the player). 

For Schopenhauer, humour is "the suddenly perceived incongruity between a concept" and the real". Conceptually, that Sisyphus could be happy is absurd; in reality, you are; ergo, funny.

Okay, so: what makes <a href="https://youtu.be/C6119Q9pDAk?t=478"><strong>this</strong></a> a joke?

*Mess Adventures* is an extremely mean platformer. It is also, with little dialogue or writing at all, extremely funny. Where 

Or, as comedian/streamer/*Great Australian Bake Off* host Tom Walker so eloquently puts it: *i knew it i knew do you see do you see they changed the fucking layout they ththththththey took it away.*

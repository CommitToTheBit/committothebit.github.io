This isn't a blog about stubbing - but it is more or less my blog's equivalent of a stub. between my previous post about <a href="https://sammakesgames.com/posts/pgo-but-better/"><strong>profile-guided optimisation</strong></a> (PGO), and another, much larger project of mine that I'm not quite ready to share just yet.

J. Ryan Stinnett's <a href="https://convolv.es/guides/lto/">guide<strong>guide</strong></a> is surprisingly comprehensive for how accessible it is. But, in the lead up to shipping *Tomb Raider*, a senior dev at Feral asked me a really quite good question,

which was enough to convince me a circuitous and more-than-a-little 
-self-indulgent answer might be in order.

  <h2>The Prototype</h2>
  <p>This demo's been a long time coming. While I only started on the current iteration of <i>Bad Bohemians</i> in early 2024, I'd originally come up with the game as a way-too-ambitious project for one of my Master's modules. Obviously, this prototype had some superficial differences (it only ran in a console, for a start), but the structure of the generator remains the same: starting with a logic puzzle solver class, we generate a bunch of clues, find a subset that lead the solver to the correct answer, then iterate that subset until the puzzle is challenging enough. First time around, that iteration was done with a genetic algorithm; the solver underpinning it a rule-based system.</p>
  <p>[Paragraph on the original solver: "if-then statements"]</p>
  <p>Even at [Reflection, boiling down to three core issues:] the solver was slow, the text generation rigid, the genetic algorithm unlikely to produce preferable mutations. Still got an A+ though, so make of that what you will.</p>

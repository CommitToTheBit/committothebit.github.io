  <p><i>Bad Bohemians</i> [description]</p>
  <p>In its current state, <i>Bad Bohemians</i> is truly the stereotype of a programmer's game: the art is amateurish and the audio non-existent, but <strong>god</strong> has it been optimised to hell and back. Some of these optimisations, like my use of Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) and my abuse of uint64_ts, make Godot particularly angry when trying to export it for web, so we've had to come to a compromise. While the full, Windows demo generates puzzles dynamically, this HTML version can only showcase a finite set of pre-generated example. Like any stereotypical programmer's game, though, they might still be more impressive to read about than they are to actually play...</p>

    <p><strong>Controls </strong>LMB to open dropdowns and select elements. RMB to clear selected elements, and grey out elements from dropdowns. Q/E to cycle through characters. Once three characters have the correct forename, surname, nobility <i>and</i> domain selected, these elements will be confirmed (<i>i.e.</i> these elements will change font, and may no longer be changed).<p>
    <p>W/S to show/hide the pinboard. Drag pins with LMB to move. Drag/click pins with RMB to connect/disconnect. Scroll mouse wheel while holding RMB to change colour of yarn.</p>

  <h2>The Prototype</h2>
  <p>This demo's been a long time coming. While I only started on the current iteration of <i>Bad Bohemians</i> in early 2024, I'd originally come up with the game as a way-too-ambitious project for one of my Master's modules. Obviously, this prototype had some superficial differences (it only ran in a console, for a start), but the structure of the generator remains the same: starting with a logic puzzle solver class, we generate a bunch of clues, find a subset that lead the solver to the correct answer, then iterate that subset until the puzzle is challenging enough. First time around, that iteration was done with a genetic algorithm; the solver underpinning it a rule-based system.</p>
  <p>[Paragraph on the original solver: "if-then statements"].</p>
  <p>Even at [Reflection, boiling down to three core issues:] the solver was slow, the text generation rigid, the genetic algorithm unlikely to produce preferable mutations. Still got an A+ though, so make of that what you will.</p>

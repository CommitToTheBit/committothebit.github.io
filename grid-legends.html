  <h2>Nuts and Bolts</h2>
  <p>Whenever I'd tell friends what I was up to at Feral, I'd always get the same question: but <i>GRID</i>'s already been made? Unfortunately (or fortunately, if you happen to be on a porting house's payroll) it's not so simple. One of the two major obstacles in shipping an AAA title to mobile is optimising its graphics, which is more or less the art of Running The Game At 60FPS Without It Burning Your Fingerprints Off. The other is the UI.</p>
  <p>As a generalist, one of my core responsibilities in the year-and-change I spent on <i>GRID</i> was helping overhaul its user interface. From the HUD to the frontend to pause menu, pretty much every screen in the game needed tailoring to the handheld experience. What this meant for me was getting comfortable navigating a knotty codebase, day in, day out. Though I always had my particular niches, with time I could jump into just about any screen and help my team fix what was needed - more often than not by jury-rigging the Codemasters UI to do things it was never meant to!</p>

  <h2>Be Kind, Rewind</h2>
  <p>Hand in hand with rebuilding a game's UI for mobile comes the challenge of redesigning its control scheme - and while, yes, I got to make a couple gamepad-related tweaks like adding support for Backbone controllers, the priority was always our new touch inputs. Making these inputs feel like more than just dragging a cursor about the screen was something I did throughout the project, particularly as I took on responsibility for <i>GRID</i>'s Replay and Photo Mode. After the usual process of reformatting their original UI templates, </p>

  <h2>Under the Hood</h2>
  <p>That said, not all of my work on <i>GRID</i> was necessarily user-facing: I'm still rather proud of how I refactored the graphics menu. [...] hooking up new, mobile-focused settings to our UI and save system, whilst keeping the full suite accessible in internal builds for benchmarks and other performance tests.</p>

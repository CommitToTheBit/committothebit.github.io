  <h2>Nuts and Bolts</h2>
  <p>Whenever I'd tell friends what I was up to at Feral, I'd always get the same question: but <i>GRID</i>'s already been made? Unfortunately (or fortunately, if you happen to be on a porting house's payroll) it's not so simple. One of the two major obstacles in shipping an AAA title to mobile is optimising its graphics, which is more or less the art of Running The Game At 60FPS Without It Burning Your Fingerprints Off. The other is the UI.</p>
  <p>As a generalist, one of my core responsibilities in the year-and-change I spent on <i>GRID</i> was helping overhaul its user interface. From the HUD to the frontend to pause menu, every single screen in the game needed tailoring to the handheld experience. What this meant for me was getting comfortable navigating a knotty codebase, day in, day out. With time, I could jump into just about any screen and help fix it up as needed - more often than not by jury-rigging Codemasters' UI to do things it was clearly never meant to!</p>

  <h2>Be Kind, Rewind</h2>
  <p>Hand in hand with rebuilding a game's UI for mobile comes the challenge of redesigning its control scheme - and while, yes, I got to make a couple gamepad-related tweaks like adding support for Backbone controllers, the priority was always our new touch inputs. Making these inputs feel like they're doing more than just emulating a cursor was a focus throughout the project, particularly as I took on responsibility for <i>GRID</i>'s Replay and Photo Mode. On top of the usual process of reformatting the original UI templates, I had to expand our existing gesture recognition system to process the pinching and panning gestures that control the player camera. I'm proud of how these turned out, given all the technical and design considerations that go into such deceptively simple features.</p>
  <p>At a lower level, working on these screens would also help familiarise me with the nuances of the Android API. In Photo Mode, for example, players would want to save in-game pictures to their device... but where to store them in <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage"><strong>Android's file system</strong></a>? It couldn't be the internal storage (which gets deleted if the player uninstalls their game), nor the app-specific external storage (to which other apps are denied read permissions), whereas creating a <i>GRID Legends</i> folder in the shared external storage and scanning it to the MediaStore API will collate the pictures into an album that shows up in photo gallery apps. Similarly, sharing photos required reading up on Android's pop-up messages; converting them to the right ImageFormat needed a well-placed swizzle or two. These quality of life features weren't added to <i>GRID</i>, but Feral's libraries themselves - by keeping my code clean and non-specific, the next dev porting a game's photo mode to mobile should have that much more to go on.</p>

  <h2>Under the Hood</h2>
  <p>Refactoring the graphics menu was first and foremost . Seeing as we were simplifying the user-facing settings, . I was hooking up our flashy new mobile-only settings to the UI and save system, whilst keeping the full suite accessible in internal builds for benchmarking and other performance tests.</p>
  <p>Most challenging here was getting the game's graphics presets up and running. Something it's  appreciated about mobile development was the [Per-device nature.] Moreover, [specs] [...] coordinating with QA, Design, and Tools, to fine-tune . At the very least, I was sure to hook the specs </p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hqt8JkYRdI&amp;t=1311s">Oskar St√•hlberg</a></strong> has talked at length about the maths of <em>Townscaper</em>'s organic grids. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304628359_Diegetically_Grounded_Evolution_of_Gameworld_Languages"><strong>James Ryan</strong></a> and <a href="https://pcgworkshop.com/archive/johnson2016procedural.pdf"><strong>Mark R. Johnson</strong></a> offer insight on generating in-game languages. Writing my own <strong><a href="https://committothebit.github.io/focalised-story-sifting/">Master's dissertation</a></strong> on emergent narrative, I'd come across techniques like these, but there just wasn't the space for them in the finished project; <em>Lingua</em> <em>Franca</em> is my excuse to finally try and implement them myself...</p>
    <strong>Made With </strong></em>Unity, C#.

  <p>As I say, I'm making this for my own entertainment - it's an on-going exercise in researching, adapting and optimising procgen techniques, as I try and fit them all in one place. So far, I've got the above world editor toy up and running, but I still don't know the final shape <em>Lingua Franca</em> is going to take.</p>
